The parasitic blood fluke _Schistosoma_ _haematobium_ causes urogenital schistosomiasis in humans and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality across sub-Saharan Africa. _S_. _haematobium_ can hybridize with closely-related livestock schistosomes, including _S_. _bovis_, however the frequency, direction, age and genomic consequences of hybridization in nature are unknown. We sequenced 96 _S_. _haematobium_ exomes from Niger and the Zanzibar archipelago. We found evidence of an ancient, adaptive introgression event between Nigerien _S_. _haematobium_ and _S_. _bovis_ occurring 108-613 generations ago. Introgressed S. bovis alleles constitute 3.3-8.2% of Nigerien _S_. _haematobium_ genomes. Some _S_. _bovis_ alleles have reached high frequency and show signatures of directional selection; the strongest signal spans a single gene in the invadolysin gene family, an M8 metalloprotease associated with parasitic life-history traits.
